Keensy is a 3d printed custom mechanical keyboard with a 75% format with KMK firmware. The goal of this project is to create a cheap keyboard with good quality
### Note: the keyboard has ISO layout, ANSI layout coming soon. 

The main features of the keyboard are:
- Usb-C connector

- magnetic case 
- KMK firmware

* This project started in 2020 with the QMK firmware and a [modded Pro Micro](https://golem.hu/guide/pro-micro-upgrade/). For anyone interested in it i uploaded the duplex matrix and the .hex with the pinout in keensy.old
